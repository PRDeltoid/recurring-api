This program provides an API to track chore types and entries. The main intent is to create a CRUD app/website to reproduce the functionality of the app "Regularly" with multi-user sync functionality.


Installing
---
Make sure you have the following enviroment variables set:
DATABASE_URL=<url of database + username/password> (ie. postgres://username:password@hostname/)
PATH=<path to postgres bin>
PGDATA=<path to postgres data folder>
PGDATABASE=<postgres db name>
PGUSER=<postgres username>
PGPORT=<postgres port>
PGLOCALEDIR=<path to postgres share\local folder>
LIB_PQ_DIR=<path to postgrss lib folder>

You can use and edit the provided dotenv file, which contains a basic Windows setup for Postgres 10. If you do not wish to use the dotfile, remove it from the directory to prevent accidental envar collisions.
